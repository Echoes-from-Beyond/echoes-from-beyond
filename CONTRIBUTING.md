## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome! If possible, please allow edits from maintainers, as it makes minor changes easier.

Commit messages should adhere to [conventional commits guidelines](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13).

If you're fixing a bug, please create an issue first and reference it in your pull request. Bug fixes should _not_ contain breaking changes or introduce new features!

If you're adding a new feature, you don't _need_ to create an issue first, but it's HIGHLY recommended to do so in order to find out if your feature will be accepted before you make it!

Our CI system detects invalid code style and will fail the build. Before you commit, make sure you run `./gradlew spotlessApply`.
