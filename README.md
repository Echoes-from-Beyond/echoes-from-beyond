## Security

See `SECURITY.md` for our vulnerability disclosure policy.

## Background

This project was made to act as an early story-based experience that will be playable before the official Adventure Mode.

It has a very different theme from said official mode and we intend to integrate with rather than replace it.

## Install

This project is built using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

```
./gradlew build
```

The above will also run all tests.

**In-progress**: Any additional steps needed to build against the Hytale SDK.

## Usage

**In-progress:** Basic examples of using our mod API.

## API

**In Progress**: We don't know what facilities Hytale provides for inter-mod communication yet.
